1. To insert values into the "CMD-LIST" table in your SQLite database : 
		INSERT INTO "CMD-LIST" (id, natural_language, command, description) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, value4);

2. To fetch all natural language commands from the database : 
		SELECT natural_language FROM "CMD-LIST";

3. To delete the row with an id of 2, you would use the following query: 
		DELETE FROM "CMD-LIST" WHERE id = 2;

4. Format to update entire SQLite DB :
		-- Update record for ID 1
			UPDATE "CMD-LIST"
			SET natural_language = 'clear terminal screen',
			    command = 'clear',
			    description = 'Clear the terminal screen',
			    category = 'Other'
			WHERE id = 1;

		-- Update record for ID 2
			UPDATE "CMD-LIST"
			SET natural_language = 'copy file',
			    command = 'cp <source> <destination>',
			    description = 'Copy file from source to destination',
			    category = 'File Management'
			WHERE id = 2;

5. To sort according to ascending :  
		SELECT * FROM "CMD-LIST" 
		ORDER BY "natural_language" ASC


6. Delete ID row : 
		DELETE FROM "CMD-LIST"
		WHERE ID=8
