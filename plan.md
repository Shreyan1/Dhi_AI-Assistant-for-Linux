# Project Dhi : Plan

### Idea :
- Execute commands in Natural Language on your terminal
- Primarily Linux Based

## Things to do :
- First start out with basic commands of Linux and check whether it is working fine
- Create a sqlite db with all the descriptions
- ### Contents of the sqlite db :
    - commands
    - descriptions
    - taggings
- The natural language input by the user will be checked for the query, if it is matching, it will fetch that particular command and execute it on the terminal
- this is like the basic idea, we can optimise it far far more and make it the best thing
