## Collaboration Opportunities ü§ù

- Help populate the DB with more appropriate commands and descriptions.
- Suggest ways to train the model based on various user natural responses.
- Contribute to making Project Dhi lightweight and independent of heavy resource utilization.

## Release Plan ‚è≥

![releaseplan](./materials/milestones.png)

Note: We understand that using OpenAI API model would solve many barriers, but that's exactly the dependency we want to remove. 
Hence, Project Dhi is designed to run locally, without access to the internet. Our goal is to make it lightweight, fast and independent of any heavy resource or internet utilizations.
Well, except for the one-time unavoidable pip requirements installation.

## UI Design Prototype
